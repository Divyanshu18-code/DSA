## Problem Description

<p>Given a binary string <code>s</code>, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of <code>0</code>'s and <code>1</code>'s, and all the <code>0</code>'s and all the <code>1</code>'s in these substrings are grouped consecutively.</p>

<p>Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "00110011"
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "10101"
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s[i]</code> is either <code>'0'</code> or <code>'1'</code>.</li>
</ul>

**Hint**:

binary substring of equal 0s and 1s is **decided** by the **minimal continuous occurrence** between character groups

Example:

Given s = **000**11111

0\'s continuous occurrence = 3
1\'s continuous occurrence = 5

min(3, 5) = 3

There are 3 binary substrings of equal 0s and 1s as following:

**0**1
**00**11
**000**111

**Implementation** by character grouping in **Python**:

```
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # previous continuous occurrence, current continuous occurrence
        pre_cont_occ, cur_cont_occ = 0, 1
        
        # counter for binary substrings with equal 0s and 1s
        counter = 0
        
		# scan each character pair in s
        for idx in range(1, len(s)):
            
            if s[idx] == s[idx-1]:
                
                # update current continuous occurrence
                cur_cont_occ += 1
            
            else:
                # update counter of binary substrings between prevous character group and current character group
                counter += min(pre_cont_occ, cur_cont_occ)

                # update previous as current\'s continuous occurrence
                pre_cont_occ = cur_cont_occ
                
                # reset current continuous occurrence to 1
                cur_cont_occ = 1
        
        # update for last time
        counter += min(pre_cont_occ, cur_cont_occ)
        
        return counter
```
